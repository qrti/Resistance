# Resistance
C# Console Application that tries to find the best combination of two resistors to fit a given resistance. 
Enter target resistance in Ohm, the resulting combination, parallel or serial, deviation in Ohm and percent is calculated.
Resistor series E3, E6, E6, E12, E24 can be set in source.
